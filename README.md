Today we are going to discuss about file organizer by using python.

So, first of all what is file organizer ? 

File organizer is nothing but it arrangement of files in directories.

So, we are going to import packages.

import os and import shutil

Then we have take path input. 

Path is nothing but it is a variable in which it takes file inside the path.

Now, using for loop statement, so we can traverse through all files.

Then we want to slicing the filename.

Next, we are separate filename and extension in every files.

So, what is extension ?

Extension is nothing but for ex- code.png 

So, code is filename and .png is extension.

Now, we are using conditional statements.

In IF statement if the extension directory is already exits then automatically move file into directory.

In ELSE statement, if directories is not exists then make a new directories and move automatically.

Now its done, lets run this code......
